1. <span style="color:Black; font-size: 14px;"> Shared e-scooter services and road safety: Evidence from six European countries, <b>*European Economic Review* 160 (2023): 104593. </b>   <br> *(with [Simon He√ü](https://hesss.org/) and [Johannes Kassinger](https://www.johanneskasinger.com/))*   </span> <br>
	
	<p style="color:Black; font-size: 10px;"> We estimate the causal effect of shared e-scooter services on traffic accidents by exploiting the variation in the availability of e-scooter services induced by the staggered rollout across 93 cities in six countries. Police-reported accidents involving personal injuries in the average month increased by around 8.2% after shared e-scooters were introduced. Effects are large during summer and insignificant during winter. Further heterogeneity analysis reveals the largest estimated effects for cities with limited cycling infrastructure, while no effects are detectable in cities with high bike-lane density. This difference suggests that public policy can play a crucial role in mitigating accidents related to e-scooters and, more generally, to changes in urban mobility. </font> </p>

	<p id="abstract2" style="display: none; text-align: justify; width: 75%;"><font size="2.5"> Reputation plays a crucial role in business and trade. In this paper, we argue that contract-intensive industries are more likely to suffer from a reputation trap due to their heavy reliance on relationship-specific inputs that are otherwise not sold on exchange. We then argue that a way out of this trap is to have a third-party organization signalling reputation on behalf of them. We test the effectiveness of this strategy using the Olympics Games as an instrument to signal reputation and to increase the export levels of contract-intensive industries. We find that hosting the Olympics lead to ~20% increase in the exports of these industries compared to non-contract-intensive industries. </font> </p>
