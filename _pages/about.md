I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Goethe University Frankfurt.

I am an applied microeconomist with a focus on mobility, infrastructure, development and the environment. I study how mobility and infrastructure effect developmental and environmental outcomes using administrative and remote sensed data and methods from microeconometrics.
