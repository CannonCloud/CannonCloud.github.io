## Interactive Fixed Effects OLS Playground

This page provides access to an interactive application for exploring Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

The application allows you to experiment with different parameters and visualize the results.

**[Click here to launch the TWFE OLS Play Around App](https://cannoncloud.shinyapps.io/TWFE_OLS_Play_Around/)**

You can [add more description here, perhaps explain what the app does, how to use it, or any relevant context].
